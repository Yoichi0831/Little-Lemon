Given the extensive use of these ingredients, we meticulously focus on food preparation but must acknowledge that eliminating cross-contamination entirely is not feasible. Consequently, while we strive to accommodate dietary preferences and restrictions, we regret to inform that we cannot serve guests with severe allergies or those at risk of anaphylactic reactions. We deeply appreciate your understanding and cooperation in ensuring the safety and well-being of all our guests</p>"
